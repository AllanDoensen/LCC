What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoin.org/en/download, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).

What is Bitcoin LCC?
--------------------

Bitcoin Lossy Compression Chain (LCC) is a blockchain replacement for the Bitcoin MemPool that is designed to increase scalability of Bitcoin without causing a hard fork of the blockchain. 

*** This project is experimental and is not yet operational. ***

Development Process

completely stable.

Current Progress
----------------

<<< 14-Mar-2017
	Changed default port from 8333 to 8331. Bitcoin & BitcoinLLC can now be run at the same time on a single device (only tested with Unbuntu Linux).

<<< 13-Mar-2017 
	Updated the name of the application and default directories. Name is now 'Bitcoin LCC' or 'bitcoinlcc' etc.

<<< 12-Mar-2017
	Move the default linux path for the blockchain from ".bitcoin" to ".lcc_bitcoin". Ditto for other OS.

<<< 11-Mar-2017
	Added minor notes and GUI changes to indicate that this is not a bitcoin core blockchain. Started work on making this code 'alt-coin' like.

<<< 11-Mar-2017
	Removed block reward. When a block is created no block reward is given, the LCC relies on fees in bitcoin only. It does not generate it's own native token.   

<<< 10-Mar-2017 
	First release.
